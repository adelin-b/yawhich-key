![preview](./docs/assets/yawhich-key.gif)

# Get started
`./yawhich-key`

Configure your custom commands like `./layers/core.json` and chain them by calling `./yawhich-key layers/custom-layer.json`

# Roadmap
- [x] Basic secquence key handling
- [ ] Configure through bash script or yaml with env var instead of json
- [ ] App specific yawhich-key (priority for vscode)
- [ ] Easy sharing layers with community through gist upload commands (inspired by pet)
- [ ] Standalone program (not using rofi), handle special keys shortcuts

# Contributing
Any contribution is welcome, especially ideas of usefull shortcuts
