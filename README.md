# yawich-key

This repositiry is a work in progress

An universal which-key shortcut displayer inspired from emacs-which-key 

# Get started
`./yawhich-key`

Configure your custom commands like `./layers/core.json` and chain them by calling `./yawhich-key layers/custom-layer.json`

# Roadmap
- [ ] Configure through bash script or yaml with env var instead of json
- [ ] App specific yawhich-key (priority for vscode)
- [ ] Easy sharing layers with community through gist upload commands 
- [ ] Standalone program (not using rofi)

# Contributing
Any contribution is welcome, especially ideas of usefull shortcuts
